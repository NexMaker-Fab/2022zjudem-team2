<br>

[AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/free-trial) is a computer-aided design software developed by the company Autodesk (hence the name AutoCAD). It allows you to draw and edit digital 2D and 3D designs more quickly and easily than you could by hand.

<br><h1 style="font-size:1.5vw"><span style="color:black">History</span></h1>
<br>

[AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/free-trial) first became notable because it was the first [CAD](https://all3dp.com/2/what-is-cad-software/) program developed for PC use (instead of industrial computers) in the 1980s. With computer hardware becoming more capable, the company behind AutoCAD, Autodesk, wanted to make CAD accessible to more people. 
<br><br>
AutoCAD has remained the dominant program in many design industries because it’s continuously updated. There’s a new version released every year, and new features are always being added.

<br><h1 style="font-size:1.5vw"><span style="color:black">Characteristics</span></h1>
<br>AutoCAD’s core competency is 2D design. Its workspace is basically a drafting desk on your computer, and this hasn’t changed since its introduction.

<br><br>

At the same time, [AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/free-trial) has kept up with the times. When 3D computer-aided design became popular, AutoCAD integrated corresponding capabilities to the rest of its feature toolbox.

<br><br>
In support of both 2D and 3D design, AutoCAD features a range of commands that help with precision, such as centering lines and marks automatically calculated from your design size and placement, drawing dimensions that can be set to fixed proportions, and geometric arrays that help you more quickly replicate patterns.

<br><br>
For working in 3D, AutoCAD offers a variety of ways to view your design, so you can work on it at every angle. Whatever dimension you’re in, the software automatically saves useful design data for sharing and future reference. We’ll talk about specific features that are especially interesting in more detail later.
