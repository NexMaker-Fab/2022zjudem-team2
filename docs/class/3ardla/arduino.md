Arduino has over the years released over 100 hardware products: boards, shields, carriers, kits and other accessories. In this page, you will find an overview of some active Arduino hardware
<li><a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/hardware#classic-family"><h1 style="font-size:1vw"><span style="color:green">Classic Family</span></h1></a></li>

In the Classic Family, you will find boards such as the legendary Arduino UNO and other classics such as the Leonardo & Micro. These boards are considered the backbone of the Arduino project, and has been a success for many years (and more to come).

“Open hardware,” or “open source hardware,” refers to the design specifications of a physical object which are licensed in such a way that said object can be studied, modified, created, and distributed by anyone.

<br><h1 style="font-size:1.5vw"><span style="color:black">About Arduino</span></h1>
Arduino can sense the environment throught a variety of sensors, and feedback and influence the environment by controlling lights,motors and other devices. The microcontroller on the board can be programmed in the Arduino programming language, compiled into binary files. The programm is implemented using the Arduino programming language (based on wiring) and the Arduino development environment (based on processing). Arduino based projects can include only Arduino, or they can include Arduino and some other software running on a PC, and they communicate with each other (such as Flash, Processing, MaxMSP) to achieve. 

<br><h1 style="font-size:1.5vw"><span style="color:black">Open Source</span></h1>

1. Definition

Open source products include permission to use the source code, design documents, or content of the product. It most commonly refers to the open-source model, in which open-source software or other products are released under an open-source license as part of the open-source-software movement. Use of the term originated with software, but has expanded beyond the software sector to cover other open content and forms of open collaboration. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source)                                                                                                                                                                                                    <br>
* Open Source Software
<br>An Open-source software is a program that has publicly available code which anyone with technical expertise can use, modify and distribute. These types of software solutions don't always solve the same problems. In fact, most open-source software is geared towards different niche solutions. However, because it is accessible to the general public, it is typically very easy to obtain and incorporate into digital solutions.
<br>Now, it is important to remember that just because open source software is free to use, it doesn't mean that just anyone can use it. Open-source software refers to lines of code (and its variations) that are available. So, depending on the type of this software, you'll likely still need a qualified software developer to inspect that code, customize the software to your specifications, and integrate it into your current operations.
<br>
Open source CRM
<br>CRM (customer relationship management) software allows companies to manage customer interactions and meet their requirements easier.
<br>In other words, it helps businesses improve customer care which is essential in boosting client satisfaction and bringing profitability.  

<br>This software makes it possible to stay organized and boost your productivity as well. There are different open source examples for CRM and they are usually free to download.

<br>However, they do require technical ability to use and are customizable to your needs.
<br>
