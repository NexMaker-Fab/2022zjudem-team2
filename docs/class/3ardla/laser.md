<h1 style="font-size:1vw"><span style="color:red">1. Introduction</span></h1>
     Laser cutting devices are very versatile tools that can be used to cut or drill wood, plastics, and metals. These devices are often very economical, efficient and can easily be automated. Due to these features, these devices have found their way to campus and before purchasing or using this type of equipment, there are some things to consider.
<h1 style="font-size:1vw"><span style="color:red">2. Laser Hazard Classification</span></h1>
Typically, LASER cutters are classified by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) as Class 1 LASERs. Class 1 LASERs emit low levels of energy that are not hazardous to the eyes or skin. However, enclosed within these devices are often Class 3B or 4 LASERs, which are capable of emitting high levels of energy, and are hazardous to the eyes and skin. Only manufacturer-trained personnel should perform maintenance on the device.

- DO NOT modify or disable any safety features of the laser system.
- DO NOT operate the laser unless all covers are in place and interlocks are working properly.
- DO NOT look directly into LASER beam.

<h1 style="font-size:1vw"><span style="color:red">3. Laser Generated Air Contaminants</span></h1>
While LASER cutters typically pose little hazard due to the Class 1 Enclosure, these devices can pose a hazard when the beam is used to cut or drill certain metals, plastics, and other materials. As the beam strikes these materials, there is potential to produce Laser-Generated Air Contaminants. These contaminants may be gaseous or particulate and can, under certain conditions, pose health risks to those exposed to them. The contaminant generated will depend on the type of material that is being cut or drilled. Cutting or drilling of some materials can generate airborne benzene, toluene, hydrochloric acid, isocyanates and other by-products which may be hazardous.

<h1 style="font-size:1vw"><span style="color:red">4. Filtration and Ventilation Requirements</span></h1>
To control the LASER-generated air contaminants, filtration and/or exhaust systems must be used to reduce or eliminate personnel exposures. In addition to reducing or eliminating personnel exposures, proper removal of contaminants is essential to ensure a properly functioning LASER cutter, as well as producing a quality product. The choice of whether to use filtration or exhaust systems will be specified by the manufacturer and these specifications should be followed. 

<h1 style="font-size:1vw"><span style="color:red">5. Laser safety</span></h1>
Most types of lasers operating in the visible and near infrared regions are sufficiently intense as to represent a hazard to the eye. Although damage may be caused to all parts of the eyes, the most vulnerable part is the retina, on which the beam may be focussed by the eye lens resulting in the destruction of tissues and the creation of permanent blind spots. High power lasers can also damage the skin. Only trained peaple can operate the machine, and we must close the enclosure before run the machine.

<h1 style="font-size:1vw"><span style="color:red">6. Laser classes</span></h1>
The current laser classes in national laser classes are: 1, 2, 3A, 3B and 4. The class of each laser must be marked clearly by the supplier.

Class 1:It is safe in the reasonable working condition, and no specific safety controls are required.
Class 2: Wavelength range from 400nm to 700nm, visible lasers
Class 3A: Lower risk than 3B, but direct viewing of beam usually safe
Class 3B: Intrabeam viewing not safe to the eye, diffusely reflected beam usually safe to the eye, assumed to be safe to the skin.
Class 4: Those that generate the hazardous diffusely reflected beam, which may be harmful to the eye or skin, and can present a fire hazard.
During normal operation, the machine is enclosed and laser classification is Class 1. In normal usage the interlocked machine does not allow exposure to any dangerous laser radiation. The cutting chamber is fully enclosed during standard operation and keys are needed to access all body panels that open. In school's safety rule,laser operator need wear normal PPE (Laboratory coat, Safety glasses, Dust mask).
